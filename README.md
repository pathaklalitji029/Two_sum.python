# Two_sum.python
This repository contains an  optimised code of two sum  problem using a hash map in python.

#Apporach to solve the problem 

1.we create the empty dictionary to store the index of the valiues to show the result 
2. then run a for loop and traverse the the loop in whole array to find the traget result 
3.find the rem or complement of of the values of array
4. check that the rem are in the dict or not if in the dictionary then we find the target result and show the index as per the solution 

  if not then forwad theb loop and traverse the loop to th next no and 
5. repeat the process until we found the result 


# time complexity O(n)
# space complexity O(n)
